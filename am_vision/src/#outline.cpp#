/**
 * 1. Create class or object to hold the image, possibly with the depth information,
 * 	  together with the pose information.
 * 2. When the covariance of pose is small, push the above class into the line.
 *    Could subscribe to /odometry/filtered for example.
 * 3. When the covariance is small, do the image comparation and then trianglation.
 * 4. When the covariance is large, do the image comparation and see if match with 
 *    known images. Extract the pose estimated if possible.

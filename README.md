>The main repository for Husqvarna Research Platform. This repo contains the basic software and models for you to bring up and run the HRP-enabled mower.
The repository will work with ros (see ros.org) kinetic and indigo releases. Please check documentation for detailed information.
>
>### Usage
>In order to use this, you need to have access to an Automower (with HRP-enabled firmware). If you have a nice research project please do not hesitate to contact us to see if you can 
>get one as well...we are always interested in nice new research!
>
>NOTE! This is not a GENERAL OFFER and it is not a product you can buy! 
>It is not possible to run HRP on commercial available mowers. To get this to work you need to get the mowers from us (loaded with a 
>special firmware not publically available). In order to get a mower, please apply to us with the research idea you have (like a one-pager) 
>and we will evaluate this against all other applicants. Also note that this offer is directed at research institutes and/or univerisities 
>conducting robotics research. For companies, you are free (and most welcome!) to contact us with ideas for possible co-operation 
>where this can be utilized as a part of that co-operation, but the mowers are not generally available to companies.

>### Cloning
